## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, recommendation systems are crucial for enhancing user experiences across various platforms. With a solid foundation in data science and extensive experience in accounting and revenue management, I have developed a sophisticated hybrid recommendation system. This project highlights my technical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and algorithm development, aimed at providing personalized movie recommendations.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that integrates both collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF) techniques. By leveraging my expertise in data science and my proficiency in Python, I have built a robust system that delivers highly accurate and relevant recommendations.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation, machine learning, and automation.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Surprise Library**: For collaborative filtering algorithms.
- **SQL**: For data extraction and manipulation.

## Project Highlights

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

- **Data Integration**: Loaded and preprocessed movie and ratings datasets, merging them for a comprehensive view of user interactions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted release years from titles, one-hot encoded genres, and normalized features for better performance.

### Time Decay and Normalization

- **Time Decay Application**: Applied time decay to ratings, prioritizing recent interactions for more relevant recommendations.
- **Score Normalization**: Ensured consistency in scores, normalizing them to a 0.5-5.0 scale for fair comparison.

### Collaborative Filtering

- **Algorithm**: Utilized SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for collaborative filtering.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employed GridSearchCV for optimal model parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed model performance using RMSE, MAE, and additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Content-Based Filtering

- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculated similarity between items based on feature vectors.
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combined CF and CBF scores using a weighted sum to generate final recommendations.

### Evaluation and Results

- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and managed outliers to maintain recommendation accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Evaluated model using hit rate, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and average precision at K (AP@K).

## Results

- **Model Performance**: Achieved competitive RMSE and MAE scores, indicating high accuracy in predicted ratings.
- **Comparison with Industry Standards**: Evaluated model metrics against industry benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in several areas.
- **Visualization**: Plotted distributions of scores before and after normalization, providing insights into the effectiveness of the normalization process.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to design and implement sophisticated recommendation systems using advanced data science techniques. Through careful preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, I created a robust hybrid recommendation system that can significantly enhance user experiences by providing highly relevant movie recommendations. My goal is to leverage these skills to contribute to innovative projects and drive impactful solutions in the field of data science.
