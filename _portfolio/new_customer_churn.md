## Project Overview

This project aimed at developing a predictive model for identifying customers at high risk of churn in the telecom sector, using the Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset.

### Objective

Creating a robust model to predict customer churn, enabling targeted customer retention strategies.

### My Role

- **Data Analysis**: Employed Python and Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn for visualization.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed models using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting techniques with Scikit-learn.
- **Innovations**: Implemented advanced feature engineering and robust scaling to enhance model accuracy.

## Key Achievements

- **Model Performance**: Achieved high accuracy in predicting churn, enhancing the ability to identify at-risk customers.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Uncovered significant churn predictors, aiding in the formulation of informed retention strategies.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Demonstrated expertise in handling complex data sets and modeling techniques.

## Impact

The project provided actionable insights, enabling the formulation of effective churn-prevention strategies, thereby potentially increasing customer loyalty and retention rates.

Recommended Visualizations:

For your customer churn prediction project, prioritizing visualizations that effectively communicate your most significant findings and skills is essential. I would recommend these key visualizations:

Model Performance Metrics: A comparison chart of your models' performance, such as ROC curves or a precision-recall curve. This effectively showcases the predictive power of your models and your skill in evaluating them.

Feature Importance: A bar chart showing the most critical features identified by your models, like Random Forest. This helps in understanding what drives customer churn and demonstrates your ability to extract actionable insights from the model.

Predictions vs. Actual Results: A simple visualization, like a confusion matrix, that shows the actual versus predicted churn. It gives a straightforward view of the model's effectiveness in real-world terms.

These three types of visualizations collectively provide a strong overview of your project: they demonstrate the effectiveness of your models, your ability to derive insights from complex data, and the practical applicability of your work. They are also likely to be easily understood by a broad audience, including those who may not have deep technical expertise.
