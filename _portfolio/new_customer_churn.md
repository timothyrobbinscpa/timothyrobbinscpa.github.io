#### Project Overview
In this data science project, I focused on analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecom sector. The goal was to identify customers at risk of discontinuing services, enabling targeted strategies for retention.

#### Data Used
The analysis centered around the Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, detailed with customer behaviors and trends. This provided a comprehensive base for understanding the factors contributing to churn.

#### Techniques and Tools
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigated factors like total day minutes and customer service calls, uncovering key trends and patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Used Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models. These methods were chosen for their robustness in handling imbalanced datasets like ours.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Emphasized recall, alongside precision and F1 score, to accurately capture churn cases.

#### Key Findings
- Identified high daily usage, international plans, and frequent service calls as major churn indicators.
- The Random Forest model showed a high recall of 82.11%, indicating its effectiveness in identifying true churn cases.
- Gradient Boosting balanced recall with a precision rate of 89.74%, highlighting its accuracy in predicting churn.
