## The Quest to Unravel Churn Patterns
**Overview**: Tackling customer churn, a critical challenge across business landscapes, became the core of my mission. Blending data science with nuanced insights from my accounting background, I aimed to reveal the underlying factors of customer turnover and devise retention-enhancing strategies.

## Deep Dive into the Churn Phenomenon
**Investigating Customer Dynamics**: With the Orange Telecom’s Churn Dataset at my disposal, I embarked on an analytical expedition. This wasn't just about crunching numbers; it was about piecing together a story from data, transforming figures into a comprehensive narrative on customer retention.

## Navigating Data Complexities
**Facing an imbalanced dataset with significant outliers and skewness**, I employed targeted data science techniques for robust analysis. Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation, robust scaling, and model optimizations like weight ratio adjustments and subsampling were pivotal for accurate churn prediction.

## Unveiling the Drivers of Churn
**Identifying Key Factors and Feature Importances**: Analysis revealed that customer service calls, total day charge, international plan subscriptions, and other factors were key indicators of churn. The Random Forest model emphasized service calls, while Gradient Boosting highlighted day charges and international plans, guiding our strategy development. A visual comparison of the top feature importances between the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models can be seen below:

## Turning Insights into Strategies
**Crafting Solutions for Retention**: Based on these insights, I proposed enhancing customer service quality and revising pricing plans. Considering the significance of international plans, reevaluating these offerings could also be a crucial step in reducing churn.

## Reflecting on the Analytical Journey
**Skill Development**: This project significantly advanced my skills in advanced predictive modeling. I learned to navigate complex data characteristics and fine-tune machine learning models, a crucial ability for translating intricate data patterns into actionable business strategies.

This newly developed expertise is essential for making informed, data-driven decisions in today’s business landscape.
