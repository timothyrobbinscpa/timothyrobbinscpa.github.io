## Overview
This project is focused on predicting customer churn using machine learning. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is when a customer stops doing business or ends a relationship with a company.

## Project Goals
- Identify key factors that predict customer churn.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict which customers are at risk of churning.
- Propose strategies to improve customer retention based on model findings.

## My Role
- Data Analysis: Explored and cleaned the data using Python's Pandas library.
- Feature Engineering: Created new features that better capture customer behaviors and trends.
- Model Building: Implemented a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn to predict churn.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-Learn for machine learning

## Challenges Faced
- Imbalanced Dataset: The number of churned customers was much smaller than retained customers, making it challenging to train a balanced model.
- Feature Selection: Determining which features were most relevant for predicting churn required extensive analysis and testing.

## Results and Conclusion
Discuss what the model found, how well it performed, and what insights were gained.
