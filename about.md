## Introduction

Hello! Iâ€™m Tim Robbins, a dynamic and detail-oriented Data Scientist based in Scottsdale, AZ. With over 20 years of comprehensive experience in accounting and a recent pivot to data science, I specialize in leveraging data analysis and machine learning to provide actionable insights and support strategic decision-making. I am passionate about applying my robust analytical skill set and strong background in financial operations to solve complex data challenges.

### A Foundation in Accounting

For over two decades, I immersed myself in the world of accounting. As a Certified Public Accountant, my career spanned from auditing in public accounting to specializing in revenue management within the dynamic sectors of SaaS and software industries. At the core of my work was a deep commitment to accuracy, compliance, and strategic financial management.

### The Spark of Change: Discovering Data Science

While my career in accounting was fulfilling, I was always driven by a passion for understanding and interpreting the stories behind the numbers. This curiosity led me to explore the field of data science, where data tells its own rich stories through patterns and predictions. My interest was particularly piqued by the way data science could magnify the impact of financial decisions, revealing insights that traditional methods might overlook.

## Career Highlights and Educational Background

- Automated the order-to-cash cycle and optimized financial processes using Python at Meazure Learning Inc.
- Utilized data-driven insights for policy compliance, internal control procedures, and financial modeling as a Consultant.
- Employed machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques for revenue accounting at Saba Software and MarketLive.
- I hold a Master of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University, where I developed a deep understanding of applied data science concepts, business intelligence, and advanced data analytics approaches. I also have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting from California State University, Chico.

### Bridging Two Worlds: Skills Transfer and Reskilling

Recognizing the transformative potential of data science, I decided to not only adapt but evolve. I pursued a Master of Science in Data Science, which equipped me with cutting-edge skills in programming, statistics, and machine learning. My accounting background proved invaluable during this transition. Skills such as meticulous attention to detail, data manipulation, and a strong ethical grounding in managing financial data became my strongest allies.

### Practical Applications: Integrating Accounting with Data Science

In my role as a Revenue Manager, I had already begun to see the overlap between accounting and data science. For instance, by implementing advanced SQL queries, I could forecast revenue more accurately and identify financial discrepancies that saved companies significant amounts of money. These experiences showed me the power of data-driven decision making.

## Looking Ahead: My Data Science Aspirations

My journey from accounting to data science is driven by a vision to blend these two worlds seamlessly. I am eager to leverage my unique blend of skills in roles focused on data analytics and financial modeling. My goal is to help organizations make smarter decisions by providing deeper insights and foresights that only a data-driven approach can offer.

## Personal Interests

Beyond my professional endeavors, I have a passion for exploring a variety of personal interests that enrich my life. I am an avid hiker, finding both inspiration and rejuvenation on the trails. Traveling the world is another pursuit close to my heart. Experiencing diverse cultures, landscapes, and cuisines fuels my creativity and broadens my perspective, enhancing my professional work with a unique global view.

## Conclusion: A Unique Blend of Expertise

Transitioning from accounting to data science has not just been a career change but a transformation of how I view and understand data. I bring to the table a rare combination of financial acumen and technical prowess, ready to tackle complex problems and uncover insights that drive success. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and am keen to connect with like-minded professionals and organizations that value the convergence of data and financial insight.
