## Introduction

Transitioning from a 25-year career in accounting to data science has allowed me to leverage my analytical skills in new and exciting ways. The primary goal of this project is to predict which recipes will be popular 80% of the time and minimize the chance of showing unpopular recipes on the company's homepage. This analysis involves data validation, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and performance evaluation.

## Leveraging Accounting Skills in Data Science

My background in accounting has provided me with valuable skills that translate well into data science:

- **Data Accuracy and Validation:**  
  Ensuring the accuracy of financial records is crucial in accounting, and I applied this meticulous approach to data analysis. The data was thoroughly cleaned, checked for inconsistencies, and validated to ensure the reliability of the insights.

- **Trend Analysis:**  
  Experience in financial forecasting and trend analysis provided a strong foundation for analyzing data trends. By applying time series analysis, I detected seasonal trends and spikes in user engagement, similar to how revenue trends are analyzed over fiscal quarters.

- **Decision-Making Support:**  
  In accounting, I translated complex financial data into actionable recommendations. Similarly, my analysis of the siteâ€™s traffic data supported strategic business decisions by identifying patterns and trends.

- **Automation and Process Optimization:**  
  Automating financial processes to improve efficiency and reduce errors was a significant part of my accounting career. I applied the same mindset to data analysis, using Python scripts to automate data extraction, cleaning, and preliminary analysis, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

## Initial Data Cleaning

The initial data cleaning process was critical to preparing the dataset for analysis. This included handling missing values, transforming data, and encoding categorical variables:

    # Fill missing high_traffic values. For the target variable, NaN actually represents the values that are not 'High'.
    # Fill NA values (not high traffic) with 0.
    recipes['high_traffic'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

    # Change 'High' values in high_traffic to 1
    recipes.loc[recipes['high_traffic'] == 'High', 'high_traffic'] = 1

    # Convert high_traffic to binary (integer)
    recipes['high_traffic'] = recipes['high_traffic'].astype('int')

    # Fill missing values in 'protein', 'sugar', 'carbohydrate', and 'calories' with the median value of their respective category
    for column in ['protein', 'sugar', 'carbohydrate', 'calories']:
        recipes[column] = recipes.groupby('category')[column].transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))

### Initial Data Cleaning Insights

- **Recipe:** This numeric variable serves as the unique identifier for each recipe. No additional cleaning was required.
- **Calories, Carbohydrate, Sugar, Protein:** These columns had missing values, which I filled using the median value within each category.
- **Category:** No missing values were found; categorical data was handled with `OneHotEncoder`.
- **Servings:** No missing values were found; the data was converted to numeric and scaled.
- **High_Traffic:** This column was converted to a binary format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Distribution Analysis

Understanding the distribution of numerical features was crucial. I plotted their distributions to identify skewness, the presence of outliers, and the overall spread of values. The histograms and boxplots provided visual insights into the central tendencies and variances of key nutritional content variables.

    # Select numeric columns for plotting
    numeric_columns = ['calories', 'carbohydrate', 'protein', 'sugar']

    # Set number of rows based on number of numeric columns
    num_rows = len(numeric_columns)

    # Create subplots, set figsize
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=num_rows, ncols=2, figsize=(12, num_rows * 4))

    # Loop through relevant numeric variables
    for i, col in enumerate(numeric_columns):
        # Plot histogram on the left
        sns.histplot(recipes[col], ax=axes[i, 0])
        axes[i, 0].set_title(f'Histogram of {col}')

        # Plot boxplot on the right
        sns.boxplot(x=recipes[col], ax=axes[i, 1])
        axes[i, 1].set_title(f'Boxplot of {col}')

    # Display plot
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align:left;"><em>Figure 1: Distribution of calories, carbohydrates, protein, and sugar in the dataset, highlighting the presence of outliers in each nutritional category.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**Summary:**  
The histogram plots indicate that the majority of recipes have lower calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and sugar content. However, the presence of outliers, as seen in the boxplots, suggests that some recipes are much higher in these nutritional metrics, contributing to skewness in the data.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between different numerical variables. By analyzing the correlation matrix, I identified relationships between variables, providing insights for feature selection and model interpretation.

    # Generate correlation heatmap
    sns.heatmap(recipes.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
    plt.show()

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/recipe_traffic/correlation_matrix.png" alt="Correlation Matrix of Numeric Variables">
  <figcaption style="text-align:left;"><em>Figure 2: Correlation matrix of numeric variables showing relationships between nutritional content and the high-traffic indicator.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**Summary:**  
The correlation matrix reveals generally weak correlations between the nutritional variables, with the strongest correlation being between calories and protein. This suggests that these nutritional components largely function independently when predicting whether a recipe will be high-traffic.

### Category Analysis

Examining the proportion of high-traffic recipes by category provided insights into user preferences. The following bar plot was used to visualize the average high-traffic rate across different recipe categories.

    # Calculate high-traffic proportion by category
    high_traffic_by_category = recipes.groupby('category')['high_traffic'].mean()

    # Sort and plot results
    high_traffic_by_category.sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind='bar')
    plt.show()

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/recipe_traffic/high_traffic_recipes_by_category.png" alt="High-Traffic Recipes by Category">
  <figcaption style="text-align:left;"><em>Figure 3: Bar plot showing the proportion of high-traffic recipes across different categories.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**Summary:**  
The bar plot shows that certain categories, such as "Vegetable," "Potato," and "Pork," have higher proportions of high-traffic recipes. This suggests that users may have a preference for recipes in these categories, making them key areas to focus on for content strategy.

## Model Selection and Evaluation

The model selection process involved choosing algorithms that are well-suited to the complexity and structure of the dataset. For this project, I selected Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models because of their ability to handle large datasets with high-dimensional features and their robustness against overfitting. These models are also interpretable, which is important for understanding the factors that contribute to a recipe's popularity.

### Model Selection

    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score

    # Split data into train and test sets
    X = recipes.drop('high_traffic', axis=1)
    y = recipes['high_traffic']

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Train Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
    gb_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=5, random_state=42)

    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    gb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate models using cross-validation
    rf_cv_scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='f1')
    gb_cv_scores = cross_val_score(gb_model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='f1')

    print(f"Random Forest CV F1 Score: {rf_cv_scores.mean():.4f}")
    print(f"Gradient Boosting CV F1 Score: {gb_cv_scores.mean():.4f}")

### Model Evaluation

I evaluated the models using precision, recall, and the F1 score, which are crucial for assessing how well the models perform, particularly in the context of imbalanced data. The goal was to achieve at least an 80% recall rate, ensuring that the model accurately identifies most of the popular recipes while maintaining balanced precision to avoid too many false positives.

### Precision-Recall Curve

To ensure the model's robustness, I evaluated performance across different thresholds. Adjusting the decision threshold allowed me to balance recall and precision, tailoring the model to the specific needs of the business.

  <figcaption style="text-align:left;"><em>Figure 4: Precision-Recall curve illustrating the trade-offs between precision and recall at different thresholds for the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**Summary:**  
The Precision-Recall curve shows the trade-offs between precision and recall as thresholds change. This helps in determining the optimal threshold that maximizes the ability to correctly identify high-traffic recipes while minimizing false positives.

### Final Model

After optimizing the model, the final version was selected to predict daily high-traffic recipes for the homepage. This model was deployed with the optimal threshold, ensuring that it meets the business objective of featuring popular recipes 80% of the time.

  <figcaption style="text-align:left;"><em>Figure 5: Performance metrics of the final Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models at their optimal thresholds, demonstrating a balance between recall and precision.</em></figcaption>
</figure>

**Summary:**  
The final model performance metrics confirm that both the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models are effective at predicting high-traffic recipes. By fine-tuning the thresholds, the models achieve a strong balance between recall and precision, which is crucial for the business goal of maintaining high accuracy in recipe recommendations.

## Summary and Recommendations
