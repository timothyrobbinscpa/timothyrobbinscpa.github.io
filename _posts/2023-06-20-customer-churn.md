## Introduction

In today's highly competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is just as crucial as acquiring new ones. Understanding the factors that lead to customer churn is essential. In this detailed post, I'll take you through my journey of tackling this challenge using data science.

## Understanding the Dataset

The project is based on the Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, which includes customer attributes and a churn indicator.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first step was to dive deep into the dataset:

- Visualized distributions of various features.
- Looked for patterns or anomalies suggesting factors contributing to churn.

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.countplot(data=df, x='churn')
```

## Innovative Feature Engineering

Several feature engineering techniques were employed to enhance the model:

1. **Creating Interaction Features**:

```
   df['day_minutes_intl_plan'] = df['total_day_minutes'] * df['international_plan']
```

This feature was created to investigate if customers with high daily usage and an international plan were more likely to churn.

2. **Total Usage Metric**:

```
df['total_minutes'] = df['total_day_minutes'] + df['total_eve_minutes'] + df['total_night_minutes'] + df['total_intl_minutes']
```

Aggregating total minutes across all periods provided a comprehensive view of customer usage.

## Model Selection and Tuning

Two robust machine learning models were chosen:

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting: Selected for their robustness in handling complex datasets. Fine-tuned using grid search and cross-validation.


## Key Insights and Model Evaluation

- **Customer Service Calls**: Emerged as a significant predictor of churn.
- **Usage Patterns**: Total day minutes were highly indicative of churn likelihood.
- Gradient Boosting showed superior performance in precision and F1 score.

## Conclusions and Reflections

The project underscored the importance of a thorough EDA, the impact of feature engineering, and the nuances of model selection and evaluation.

## Challenges and Learnings

Encountered challenges like handling an imbalanced dataset and high feature dimensionality. Approaches like SMOTE and PCA were considered for future iterations.

## Closing Thoughts

I hope this deep dive gives you a sense of how data science can be applied to tackle practical problems in industries like telecom. The full code and detailed analysis for this project are available in my [GitHub repository](#).
